# Self-critical Sequence Training for Image Captioning (+ misc.)

This repository includes the unofficial implementation [Self-critical Sequence Training for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00563) and [Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998).

The author of SCST helped me a lot when I tried to replicate the result. Great thanks. The att2in2 model can achieve more than 1.20 Cider score on Karpathy's test split (with self-critical training, bottom-up feature, large rnn hidden size, without ensemble)

This is based on my [ImageCaptioning.pytorch](https://github.com/ruotianluo/ImageCaptioning.pytorch) repository. The modifications is:
- Self critical training.
- Bottom up feature support from [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998). (Evaluation on arbitrary images is not supported.)
- Ensemble
- Multi-GPU training
- Add transformer (merged from [Transformer_captioning](https://github.com/ruotianluo/Transformer_Captioning))

## Requirements
Python 2.7 (because there is no [coco-caption](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) version for python 3)
PyTorch 1.0 (along with torchvision)
cider (already been added as a submodule)

(**Skip if you are using bottom-up feature**): If you want to use resnet to extract image features, you need to download pretrained resnet model for both training and evaluation. The models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtbVYzOURMdDNHSGM), and should be placed in `data/imagenet_weights`.

## Pretrained models (using resnet101 feature)
Pretrained models are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtdE1JRXpmeGJudTg). And the performances of each model will be maintained in this [issue](https://github.com/ruotianluo/neuraltalk2.pytorch/issues/10).

If you want to do evaluation only, you can then follow [this section](#generate-image-captions) after downloading the pretrained models (and also the pretrained resnet101).

## Train your own network on COCO/Flickr30k

### Prepare data.

We now support both flickr30k and COCO. See details in `data/README.md`. (Note: the later sections assume COCO dataset; it should be trivial to use flickr30k.)

### Start training

```bash
$ python train.py --id fc --caption_model fc --input_json data/cocotalk.json --input_fc_dir data/cocotalk_fc --input_att_dir data/cocotalk_att --input_label_h5 data/cocotalk_label.h5 --batch_size 10 --learning_rate 5e-4 --learning_rate_decay_start 0 --scheduled_sampling_start 0 --checkpoint_path log_fc --save_checkpoint_every 6000 --val_images_use 5000 --max_epochs 30
```

The train script will dump checkpoints into the folder specified by `--checkpoint_path` (default = `save/`). We only save the best-performing checkpoint on validation and the latest checkpoint to save disk space.

To resume training, you can specify `--start_from` option to be the path saving `infos.pkl` and `model.pth` (usually you could just set `--start_from` and `--checkpoint_path` to be the same).

If you have tensorflow, the loss histories are automatically dumped into `--checkpoint_path`, and can be visualized using tensorboard.

The current command use scheduled sampling, you can also set scheduled_sampling_start to -1 to turn off scheduled sampling.

If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use `--language_eval 1` option, but don't forget to download the [coco-caption code](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) into `coco-caption` directory.

For more options, see `opts.py`. 

**A few notes on training.** To give you an idea, with the default settings one epoch of MS COCO images is about 11000 iterations. After 1 epoch of training results in validation loss ~2.5 and CIDEr score of ~0.68. By iteration 60,000 CIDEr climbs up to about ~0.84 (validation loss at about 2.4 (under scheduled sampling)).

### Train using self critical

First you should preprocess the dataset and get the cache for calculating cider score:
```
$ python scripts/prepro_ngrams.py --input_json .../dataset_coco.json --dict_json data/cocotalk.json --output_pkl data/coco-train --split train
```

Then, copy the model from the pretrained model using cross entropy. (It's not mandatory to copy the model, just for back-up)
```
$ bash scripts/copy_model.sh fc fc_rl
```

Then
```bash
$ python train.py --id fc_rl --caption_model fc --input_json data/cocotalk.json --input_fc_dir data/cocotalk_fc --input_att_dir data/cocotalk_att --input_label_h5 data/cocotalk_label.h5 --batch_size 10 --learning_rate 5e-5 --start_from log_fc_rl --checkpoint_path log_fc_rl --save_checkpoint_every 6000 --language_eval 1 --val_images_use 5000 --self_critical_after 30 --cached_tokens coco-train-idxs
```

You will see a huge boost on Cider score, : ).

**A few notes on training.** Starting self-critical training after 30 epochs, the CIDEr score goes up to 1.05 after 600k iterations (including the 30 epochs pertraining).

### Caption images after training

## Generate image captions

### Evaluate on raw images
Now place all your images of interest into a folder, e.g. `blah`, and run
the eval script:

```bash
$ python eval.py --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --image_folder blah --num_images 10
```

This tells the `eval` script to run up to 10 images from the given folder. If you have a big GPU you can speed up the evaluation by increasing `batch_size`. Use `--num_images -1` to process all images. The eval script will create an `vis.json` file inside the `vis` folder, which can then be visualized with the provided HTML interface:

```bash
$ cd vis
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now visit `localhost:8000` in your browser and you should see your predicted captions.

### Evaluate on Karpathy's test split

```bash
$ python eval.py --dump_images 0 --num_images 5000 --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --language_eval 1 
```

The defualt split to evaluate is test. The default inference method is greedy decoding (`--sample_method greedy`), to sample from the posterior, set `--sample_method sample`.

**Beam Search**. Beam search can increase the performance of the search for greedy decoding sequence by ~5%. However, this is a little more expensive. To turn on the beam search, use `--beam_size N`, N should be greater than 1.

## Miscellanea
**Using cpu**. The code is currently defaultly using gpu; there is even no option for switching. If someone highly needs a cpu model, please open an issue; I can potentially create a cpu checkpoint and modify the eval.py to run the model on cpu. However, there's no point using cpu to train the model.

**Train on other dataset**. It should be trivial to port if you can create a file like `dataset_coco.json` for your own dataset.

**Live demo**. Not supported now. Welcome pull request.
